## 🚀 What is Soft Landing?

Soft Landing is an AI-powered sales dashboard designed for small business owners who feel overwhelmed by spreadsheets and data.  
If you run a café, retail shop, or online store, just upload your sales file (CSV/Excel) — Soft Landing will transform it into clean dashboards, smart tips, and actionable next steps — all powered by AI.  
_No setup. No tech skills. No stress._

## 🧭 Roadmap & Vision

Currently, Soft Landing uses basic AI logic for cleaning and generating insights.  
**In the future, we plan to:**
- Integrate advanced AI tools like ChatGPT/OpenAI for even deeper, more personalized analysis.
- Allow users to customize and choose their own dashboard columns, so they can focus on the metrics that matter most to their business and get insights tailored to their specific needs.
- Explore adding real subscription logic using tools like **RevenueCat**, **Stripe**, or **Supabase** role-based access.
- Currently, subscription UI is included as a placeholder — backend functionality is planned in future versions.
